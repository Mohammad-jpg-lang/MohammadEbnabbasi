            <p>Cyberpunk 2077 is a video game by CDProjekt Red,
                the game has you play as V, either as Vincent or Valerie depending
                on what sex your character is. You grow up either from a corporate, street
                or nomad background and this will affect what dialogue options
                you will have in the game. V's job is to find purpose, and this is done
                by making a name for yourself and become one amongst legends, little

            <h2>Why Cyberpunk 2077 ?</h2>
            <p>I chose Cyberpunk 2077 because the game made me experience strong emotions,
                I have always been a fan of the Cyberpunk genre and I really enjoyed this game,
                especially in my second playthrough, playing the expansion called Phantom
                Liberty, I completed every mission and attained all the achievements, I have
                over 140 hours of gameplay time and I do not forget a single second.
